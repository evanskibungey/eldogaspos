# Cylinder Drop-off and Collection Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
I have successfully implemented a comprehensive cylinder drop-off and collection management system for your EldoGas POS application. This feature allows both **Admin** and **Cashier** users to manage customer cylinder transactions with two main workflows:

### Flow 1: Customer Leaves Cylinder First (Drop-off)
- Customer drops off empty cylinder at the store
- System records customer details, cylinder info, and payment status
- Customer returns later to collect refilled cylinder
- Staff marks transaction as "Collected" when customer picks up

### Flow 2: Customer Takes Gas Before Returning Cylinder (Advance Collection)
- Customer pays extra deposit and takes refilled cylinder immediately
- Customer returns empty cylinder later
- System processes deposit refund when empty cylinder is returned
- Transaction marked as "Returned"
